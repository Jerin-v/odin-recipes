    <h1>Chicken Stirfry</h1>
    <img src="../images/30-Minute-Chicken-Noodle-Stir-Fry-2.jpg" alt = "Stirfry">
    <p><h5>This chicken stir fry is about as easy as it gets. It starts with some cubed chicken breast, although chicken thighs also work well. I like to start with the chicken when I’m making a stir fry because as they brown, they create a layer of flavor in the skillet. When the veggies get added, the pick up some of that flavor and then develop their own. It’s these layers that give so much depth to this easy recipe. And then it’s time for the sauce…</h5></p>
